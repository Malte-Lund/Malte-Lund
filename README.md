- 👋 Hi, I’m @Malte-Lund
- 👨‍⚕️ I'm a medical doctor doing my Ph.d. in exercise studies for patients with rare autoimmune diseases.
- 👀 I’m interested in Medical Research; Especially the statistics part, and the openness of version control exploitable by Git
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, Git, and how to treat patients with rare autoimmune disease.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on medical research.
- 📫 Reach me on this page or at my email: Malte.Lund.Adamsen.02@regionh.dk if you wish to collaborate.


- Potential conflicts of interest:
-   While doing my PhD - I have received 5000DKK in speaking fees from Novartis.
-   I do not hold any equity interest in any pharmaceutical companies, however, my SO might as I am not aware of her positions.
-   Furthermore, the savings account of my young children are in stocks, and these stocks are invested in broad indexes that generally follow the S&P 500, but some of that is most likely in large pharmaceutical companies such as Novo Nordisk or Astra Zeneca.
In addition to this, being a Danish MD, my pension is obligated through my union to be invested by the doctors pension fund, I have very limited control (only through a representative democracy) or knowledge of how this investment is handled and therefore do not think it influences my decisions. 

- I self-identify as a caucassian heterosexual male assigned at birth. My pronouns are his/him.
